# Smart-Shipping-Rate
Smart Shipping Rate is a system that can calculate total shipping costs automatically based on volume of goods, mass of goods, and shipping distance.
- The volume of the goods is measured using 3 ultrasonic sensors with different axes.
- The mass of the goods is measured using a load cell sensor.
- The shipping distance is input by the user on the mobile application.
- Data is stored in a real time database on Google Firebase.
- Determination of shipping rates is done on the ESP32 using a Fuzzy Logic algorithm.
